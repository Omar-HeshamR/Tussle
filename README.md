# Known Bugs and Potential Improvments.

**Known Bugs:**

1- When entering custom names of player and empire the keyboard button "enter" is required after filling the field

2- The in-game music Is not the correct file since the actual file is above 25 MB

**Potential Improvements:**

1- The Empire taking over land system is weak, it works smooth with the main players, but faces some problems with implementing new events of empires taking over another empire. Currently is working properly but needs an improvment.

2- Addtion of more events.

3- Profcient and effcient organization of the codes and classes.
